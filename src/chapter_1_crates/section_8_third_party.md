# Third-party

Third-party crates are crates that aren't supported by the Twilight organization
but are recognised by it. Of course, use these at your own risk. :)

Third-party crates may become first-party crates if they end up becoming useful
enough for a large number of users.

## List of Crates

Below is a list of crates. If you want yours added, feel free to ask!

### `twilight-rs/permission-calculator`

The permission calculator is a crate for calculating the permissions of a
member in a channel, taking into account its roles and permission overwrites.
