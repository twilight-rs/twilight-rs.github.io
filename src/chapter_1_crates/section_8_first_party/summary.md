# First-party

Twilight includes crates maintained by the organization, but not included as
part of the core experience. Just like all of the core crates these are entirely
opt-in, but are for more advanced or specific use cases, such as integration
with other software.

Although not a part of the core experience, these are given the same level of
support as the core crates.
